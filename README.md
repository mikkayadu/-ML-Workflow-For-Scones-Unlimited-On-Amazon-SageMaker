# AWS Serverless ML Inference Pipeline

Welcome to the AWS Serverless ML Inference Pipeline project! This repository contains a serverless solution for real-time image classification(classifying bicycles and motorcycles) using AWS Lambda, Step Functions, and SageMaker.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Deploy a machine learning model on SageMaker.
- Capture real-time inference data.
- Process and analyze the inference data using Lambda and Step Functions.
- Handle exceptions and thresholds for inferences.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured with necessary permissions
- Python 3.x
- SageMaker Python SDK

## Acknowledgements

- AWS for their extensive documentation and resources.
